# CapStone-Two---Climate-Change
From an open dataset found on Kaggle, I created a problem statement and Issue Tree to begin breaking down the complex problem of this dataset. Through this project, I learned how to clean, prepare and manipulate a dataset for analysis in order to create interesting and detailed visualizations.  The final part of the presentation was to use fbprophet prediction capabilities to predict what the next 10 and even 50 years will look like based off of the data that is available.
